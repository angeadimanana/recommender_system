# Movie Recommender System 

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the implementation and evaluation of a movie recommender system based on collaborative filtering techniques, using Alternating Least Square (ALS)

## Repository Structure

---

## Source Code (`src/`)

The `src` directory contains all the source code of the project.

- **`data_struct/`**  
  Contains the data structures used throughout the project   
  These structures define how the datasets are represented and accessed.

- **`training/`**  
  Contains all functions to **model training**
  

- **`prediction/`**  
  Contains the code responsible for **generating recommendations**


---

## Notebooks (`notebooks/`)

The `notebooks` directory is used for experimentation, analysis

- **`notebook_practical/`**  
  Contains notebooks corresponding to different practical sessions, used to explore concepts step by step.

- **`hyperparameter_search.ipynb`**  
  Notebook dedicated to **hyperparameter tuning**, grid search

- **`all_model.ipynb`**  
  Main execution notebook:
  - retrains the all model on the **full dataset**,
  - produces final evaluation results and recommendations.

---

## Results (`results/`)

The `results` directory contains some outputs generated by the experiments, such as:
- RMSE plots,
- generated recommendation files.

---

##  Before running the code:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
 
mkdir data
```
